            <span>Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013 by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi in response to the 'let off' of Trayvon Martin’s murderer. Black Lives Matter Foundation, Inc is a member-led global organisation in the US, UK, and Canada,
              where members organise and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on black communities by authorities worldwide.
              <br><br>
              Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where black lives are regularly and intentionally targeted for demise. It is the support of black peoples humanity, contributions to this society,
              and resilience in the face of deadly oppression.
              <br><br>
              The goal of Black Lives Matter is to support the development of new black leaders, as well as create a network where black people feel empowered and safe to live the life they want and the life they can. (History from official <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/" target="_blank">#BlackLivesMatter</a> website - please visit to learn more)</span>.
              <br><br>
              Black Lives Matter is not an attempt to say that it is only black lives that matter. Saying 'but all lives matter' is a complete misunderstanding of what the phrase 'black lives matter' means, as it drowns out the bigger problem we have worldwide in which
              people with black skin are being unfairly treated and seen as less important than that of people with white skin. We should all know that all lives matter as we should all be treat equally, but unfortunately somehow, still in 2020, black lives are not being treated equally.
              <br><br>
              If 1 house is on fire in a street of 10 houses, in which the other 9 houses are in perfect condition, the fire brigade would not fix the problem by spraying water on the other 9 houses before they hose the house that is actually on fire. They would focus on the house that is on fire only.
              This is what the Black Lives Matter movement is. You are the fire brigade. Help and support the movement by putting the fire out on that house, meaning all 10 houses are now in perfect condition, meaning finally all lives matter.
              <br><br>
              The aim of this website, more directly to people from the UK, is to educate on the Black Lives Matter movement, the latest statistics, evidence and examples of inequality against black people and what you can do to help and support.

              If we were to compare the statistics between America and the UK, it shows clearly police brutality to be enormously higher in the States. However as explained above, Black Lives Matter is about more than just police brutality.
              It is about the injustice, unequal and harsh treatment of black people in society daily and it is very evident in both countries. Even the least racist is still racist. Please continue reading to see just some of the major examples of white supremacy, police brutality and injustice in the USA and UK.

            <span><strong>2012</strong></span>
            <p class="mb-4">Trayvon Martin was returning to his father's girlfriend's house in Sanford, Florida, after a trip to the local 7-Eleven before the NBA all-star game. He carried a bag of Skittles and a can of
              iced tea for his little brother. As he walked home, the unarmed 17-year-old spoke to his girlfriend over the phone. He was spotted by George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighbourhood watch volunteer, who was
              patrolling the gated community, the Retreat at Twin Lakes, in his vehicle. Zimmerman called 911 to report what he described as Martin's "suspicious behaviour", telling the operator he looked like he was
              "up to no good, on drugs or something". Zimmerman was warned by the operator not to follow the teenager. But he did, getting out of his vehicle and taking a 9mm handgun with him. According to neighbours,
              there was an altercation between the two men – Zimmerman, weighing 250lbs and armed, and Martin, weighing 140lbs and unarmed. Witnesses and 911 calls record one of the men in great distress crying out for help.
              A wailing voice pleads, "No! No!". By the time police arrive on the scene, Martin lay fatally wounded by a gunshot to the chest. Zimmerman has admitted to the killing but told police he fired in self-defence.
              Zimmerman still walks free today.</p>

            <span><strong>2014</strong></span>
            <p class="mb-4">A 911 caller, who was sitting in a nearby gazebo, reported that someone, possibly a juvenile, was pointing "a pistol" at random people at the Cudell Recreation Center. The caller twice said that
              the gun was "probably fake". Two officers, Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, were dispatched. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled "show me your hands" through the
              open patrol car window. Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw: "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out". In response, the officer shot twice,
              hitting Rice once in the torso. He died the following day. Rice's gun was later found to be an airsoft replica that lacked the orange-tipped barrel. In the aftermath of the shooting it was revealed that Loehmann, in his
              previous job as a police officer in the Cleveland suburb of Independence, had been deemed an emotionally unstable recruit and unfit for duty. Loehmann did not disclose this fact on his application to join the Cleveland police,
              and Cleveland police never reviewed his previous personnel file before hiring him. In 2017, following an investigation, Loehmann was fired for withholding this information on his application.</p>

            <span><strong>2015</strong></span>
            <p class="mb-4">In July of 2015, Bland had recently moved from Illinois to Texas to start a job at her alma mater, Prairie View A&M University, near Houston, when a Texas state trooper, Brian Encinia, pulled her over near the campus
              for failing to signal a lane change. Dashcam video shows the stop quickly escalate into a verbal and then physical confrontation. Apparently angered by Bland’s refusal to put out a cigarette, Encinia threatened to drag her out of the
              car and “light [her] up” with a Taser. They walk off camera, then Bland is seen with her wrists behind her back. “You’re about to break my wrist, stop,” she screamed, “you’re a real man now, you just slammed me, knocked my head into
              the ground, I got epilepsy.” She was arrested on suspicion of assault and taken to the Waller county jail. Three days later she was found dead in her cell, hanged by a plastic trash bag from a receptacle that was left in the cell.
              Encinia was indicted for perjury in 2015 after lying to a grand jury about the stop. In June 2017, the charges against Encinia were dropped in exchange for Encinia surrendering his Texas law enforcement license, meaning that no one was
              ever held criminally liable for Bland’s death, or her arrest, which many experts have concluded may have been illegal.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Stephon Clark was at his grandparents’ home on March 18 when two Sacramento police officers rolled up on him while doing a canvass of the neighborhood for a man who was breaking car windows.
              The two officers gave Clark four seconds to comply with their commands before they fired 20 shots, killing him in the backyard. A Sacramento sheriff said that Clark was armed with a crowbar.
              When the police rolled Clark’s limp body over they found only a cellphone. There was no weapon, and Clark was on his stomach when police finally did attend to him. He was 22 and the father of two little boys.
              Only a month prior, Nikolas Cruz, who did have a gun and killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, be tackled, apprehended alive and escorted out of the situation. According to the district attorney, Anne Marie Schubert,
              the officers were justified in using lethal force and did not commit a crime. “When we look at all of these facts and circumstances,” she said, “we ask ourselves, was a crime committed? “The answer to that question is no.”.
              The officers were cleared to return to active duty.</p>

            <span><strong>2020</strong></span>
            <p class="mb-4">In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but "he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that", according to a transcript released by authorities.
              Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner. After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered
              Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun. Mr Lane, prosecutors said, "put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car".
              Once handcuffed, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for "passing counterfeit currency". At about 20:14, after an ettempt to be put inside the police car, Mr Floyd "stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told
              the officers he was claustrophobic". Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car. During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd
              away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground. He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs. That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple
              mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last. Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck. "I can't breathe," Mr Floyd said repeatedly, pleading for his mother
              and begging "please, please, please". For eight minutes and 46 seconds, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors'. About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when
              Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse. One of the other officers, JA Kueng, did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but "couldn't find one". Yet the other officers did not move. At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee
              from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance. He was pronounced dead about an hour later.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Mr Bayoh had been at a friend’s house in the morning watching a boxing match and had taken the drugs MDMA and the psychostimulant ‘Flakka’. He is said to have become aggressive with a friend after ingesting the substances, before returning home and picking up a knife from his kitchen.
          Concerned neighbours contacted the police, but Mr Bayoh had discarded the knife before they arrived. Cause of death was noted as "sudden death in a man intoxicated…[drugs] whilst under restraint". However, documents reveal that before Mr Bayoh’s alleged stamping attack on the officer, three officers
          discharged their irritant spray into his face and a fourth drew her baton at him. Official police documents stated Mr Bayoh was pinned to the ground for “a maximum of 30 seconds” and the restraint had been, “appropriate, text book stuff, in line with police training.” But a civilian witness told the
          documentary team officers were lying across Mr Bayoh for several minutes, adding: "I heard him screaming. It sent chills through me. I heard the man shout to get the police off him. They never moved." Bayoh never regained consciousness after being restrained and prosecutors decided not to charge any police officers involved.</p>

        <span><strong>2016</strong></span>
        <p class="mb-4">In 2012, Sarah Reed was at the centre of a police brutality case, when a Metropolitan Police constable, James Kiddie, was caught on CCTV, yanking her by the hair, dragging her across the floor, pressing on her neck and punching her several times in the head. The footage of the assault is very painful
          to watch. Kiddie, who accused her of shoplifting, was convicted of assault, dismissed from his job, and given 150 hours community service. Reed was already struggling with mental health problems when the assault happened; her family say she had never fully recovered from the death of her nine-month-old daughter in 2003,
          after months in hospital and a distressing battle with illness. in 2016, Reed was in prison awaiting medical reports about whether she was mentally fit to plead after being charged with assaulting a nurse in a secure psychiatric unit. The reports found she was unfit to plead, but Reed killed herself three days before they were due
          to be completed. The jury concluded that Reed, 32, killed herself at a time when the balance of her mind was disturbed, but they were unsure whether she had intended to do so. They said a failure in management of her medication and the failure to conclude the fitness to plead assessment in a timely manner contributed to her subsequent death.
          They also had concerns about suicide and self-harm report monitoring and believed that Reed did not receive adequate treatment in prison for her high levels of distress. This case represents elements of racism, sexism and police brutality too often faced by black women within the system.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Belly Mujinga was a Transport For London (TfL) worker who was coughed on and spat at by a man while she was working on the concourse of London’s Victoria Station. He claimed, at the time, to be infected with Covid-19.
          Within days of the assault, Mujinga was diagnosed with the virus. And, just two weeks later, she died in a hospital in Barnet – leaving her husband, Lusamba, a widower and her 11-year-old daughter without a mother. Following Mujinga’s death,
          the British Transport Police (BTP) interviewed the man involved, but determined that the incident did not lead to the worker’s death. As such, they decided not to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). However, with over a million people signing a petition in support of Ms Mujinga, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)
          has been asked to review the evidence into her death.</p>
